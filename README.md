# DPS Backend Coding Challenge Project

## Overview

This is a backend application developed for the Digital Product School (DPS) coding challenge. The project is a web application built with TypeScript and Express.js, focusing on project and report management with a SQLite database.

## Project Description

The application provides a RESTful API for managing company projects and their associated reports. Key features include:

-   CRUD operations for projects and reports
-   A special endpoint to retrieve reports with recurring words
-   hard coded authentication mechanism :-(
-   Health check endpoint

This project came with a custom database schema with projects and reports tables. What I found was there are no foreign key relationships defined between them, and id fields are stored as text rather than auto-incrementing integers. So I implemented these features to maintain the schema

1. Custom Relationship Handling - Due to the lack of foreign key constraints, a custom function was implemented to maintain the relationship between the projects and reports tables during data insertion.

2. ID Management - Id fields are stored as text. A custom script is used to fetch the last ID and auto-increment it by 1 for new entries and convert back it to string.
3. Schema Preservation - The existing database schema is kept intact to avoid altering the original structure while ensuring the projectâ€™s functionality.

## Prerequisites

-   Node.js (v14.x or later)
-   npm (v6.x or later)

## Technology Stack

-   TypeScript
-   Express.js
-   SQLite
-   Node.js
-   Swagger (API Documentation)

## Setup and Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    cd <project-directory>
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. Run the development server:

    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

4. The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`

## API Endpoints

### Health Check

-   `GET /ping`: Health check endpoint to verify server status

### Projects

-   `GET /project`: Retrieve all projects
-   `POST /project`: Create a new project
-   `GET /project/id/:id`: Get a specific project
-   `PATCH /project/:id`: Update a project feilds
-   `DELETE /project/:id`: Delete a project

### Reports

-   `GET /report`: Retrieve all reports
-   `POST /report`: Create a new report
-   `GET /report/id/:id`: Get a specific report
-   `PATCH /report/:id`: Update a report
-   `DELETE /report/:id`: Delete a report
-   `GET /report/project/:projectid`: Get all reports associated with the given project ID.

### Special Endpoint

-   `GET /report/repeated`: Retrieve reports with words appearing at least three times

## Authentication

authentication is implemented using a hardcoded token:

-   Token: `Password123`
-   Apply to all API routes

## Documentation and Testing

Comprehensive API documentation and endpoint testing are available through Swagger:

-   **Swagger Documentation**: [https://dps-expressjs-challenge.onrender.com/api-docs](https://dps-expressjs-challenge.onrender.com/api-docs)

**Note:** The documentation link may take a few moments to load as it is hosted on the free tier of Render.

## Deployment

The application is deployed on Render:

-   **Deployment URL**: [https://dps-expressjs-challenge.onrender.com](https://dps-expressjs-challenge.onrender.com)

**Note:** Initial loading might be slower due to the free tier hosting.

## Database

-   Database: SQLite
-   Location: `db/db.sqlite3`
-   Managed through `db.service.ts`

## Submission Details

-   Completed as part of the Digital Product School Backend Coding Challenge
-   Submission deadline: One week from challenge receipt
